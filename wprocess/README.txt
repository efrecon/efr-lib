			       Abstract

    The  wprocess library is a Tcl  library that  provides an API
    compatible with the process library of the TIL but acts without
    the help of any external application.  It only works on windows.



The wprocess library provides an API that is entirely compatible with
the process library of TIL but works without any external helper
functions.  The library only works on Windows. Requiring it will
simply replace all calls to the TIL library with calls to the wprocess
implementation.

wprocess is subject to the new BSD license, I would appreciate to
incorporate any modifications and improvements that you make to the
library.

The library is hosted at the following address:
