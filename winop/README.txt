			       Abstract

    The  winop is  a library  that attempts  to provide  a unification
    layer for managing and manipulating windows.  The library provides
    equivalent for  a number of  the 'wm' and 'winfo'  commands, while
    being  able to control  both regular  Tk applications  and foreign
    Windows applications.



The winop library provides a unification layer that allows programmers
to operate on windows whichever application they are originating from.
The library provides a number of commands equivalent for the regular
Tk 'wm' and 'winfo' commands, but is able to handle both your
application' own Tk windows and foreign Windows applications.

The emulation layer is not yet complete, so this library is likely to
grow with time.  winop is subject to the new BSD license, I would
appreciate to incorporate any modifications and improvements that you
make to the library.

For the time being, winop has very little documentation and you will
have to read the code.

The library is hosted at the following address:
